Social Media Sentiment Analysis


This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets or Facebook posts using machine learning and deep learning techniques.


Key steps include:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized text data to remove noise and extract meaningful features.
Modeling: Utilized models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and deep learning architectures like RNNs and Transformers to classify sentiment into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.



The goal of this project is to analyze and interpret the sentiment expressed in social media posts, providing valuable insights into public opinion.
